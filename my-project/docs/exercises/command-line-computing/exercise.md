# "Command-line Computing" Exercise

## Objectives

Before we're able to run Node.js applications on our local machines, we'll need to achieve a basic level of familiarity with the command-line. We'll need to use the command-line to navigate the computer's filesystem and use various command-line utilities (CLIs).

## Prerequisites

  + [Local Development Environment Setup](/exercises/local-dev-setup/exercise.md)

## Instructions

Follow along with one of the following guides:

  + [Unix Command-Line / Bash](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/exercises/command-line-computing/mac-terminal.md) - RECOMMENDED FOR ALL STUDENTS (MAC OR WINDOWS)
  + [Windows Command-Prompt](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/exercises/command-line-computing/windows-command-prompt.md) - NOT RECOMMENDED

> NOTE: Commands can differ, depending on your computer's operating system. By default, most coding documentation references what is called "unix-style" commands:
>  + On Mac OS, the default Terminal application will allow students to use unix-style commands.
>  + On Windows OS, the default Command Prompt application uses different commands, but installing the Git Bash application will allow students to use unix-style commands.

## Tips

As you complete the exercise, keep in mind the following tips:

  + Pressing the up arrow will cycle through recent commands.
  + Pressing tab will auto-complete filepaths.
  + Typing "clear" and pressing enter (or just pressing "command + k" on Mac) will clear the screen.
