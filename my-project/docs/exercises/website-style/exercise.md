### Practicing CSS

Setup a new local website, or continue working in the local website you created during the Website Structure exercise.

As you learn new CSS concepts using the resources above, put them into practice in your local website.

For a guided experience, see also the [Guided Exercise Walk-through](walkthrough.md).

### Learning a Framework

After gaining a high-level familiarity with various CSS styling techniques, consider adopting a styling framework like [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/):

  + Bootstrap Layout:
    + [Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/)
  + Bootstrap Content:
    + [Typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/typography/)
    + [Images](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/images/)
    + [Tables](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/tables/)
  + Bootstrap Components:
    + [Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/)
    + [Cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/)
    + [Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/carousel/)
    + [Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/)
  + Bootstrap Utilities:
    + [Colors](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/colors/)
 
Skip Forms for now, we will return to them later

Ignore JavaScript references in the Bootstrap docs for now. We'll cover JavaScript and website interactivity in the future.

See also the Prof's [Bootstrap 5 Navbar Template](/exercises/website-style/bootstrap_5_nav.html), which provides an example Bootstrap Navbar out of the box, and feel free to leverage in your exercises and projects, as desired.
