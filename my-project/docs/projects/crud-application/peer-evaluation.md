# CRUD Application Peer Evaluation

Fill out this [CRUD App Peer Evaluation Form](https://goo.gl/forms/1OazmIISAWAgQlqb2) when instructed to do so by the professor.

This peer evaluation is worth 5% of your final grade. Thank you for taking the time to review and evaluate your peers' projects. As you complete this evaluation, please maintain an objective state of mind, focusing on the merits of the projects you are evaluating, not any personal relationships you may have with your peers. Remember, your evaluations are anonymous, and your peers will not know who evaluated their projects.

At the appropriate time, you will receive an email containing a list of five peer projects for you to evaluate. For each of these five peer projects:

  1. Paste the project link into the appropriate section of the form to indicate which project you are evaluating.

  2. Visit the project link in a browser, and take a few moments to navigate around that application to get a good feel for it. You should specifically focus on manually performing the following CRUD operations:

     + View all robots (List/Index)
     + Create a new robot (Create)
     + View a given robot (Show)
     + Edit a given robot (Update)
     + Delete a given robot (Destroy)

  3. Think about what you like about the application, and/or what you think could be improved, then type your comments into the appropriate section in the form. Feel free to focus your comments by answering the following questions:

     + Does the application perform all the necessary CRUD operations?
     + Is the application navigable and usable? Does it provide descriptive messages to help you overcome potential user errors (e.g. attempting to submit invalid form data)?
     + Did the student demonstrate an attention to detail?
     + Did the student "make this application his/her own" by offering an application structure and style which significantly differ from the checkpoint instructions?

  4. Finally, assign the project a number score from 1 (poor) to 10 (awesome) in the appropriate section.

Repeat for each assigned peer project, then submit.
