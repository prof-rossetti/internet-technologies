# CRUD Operations - Destroying Records

## Instructions

### View

Add a "Delete" button to the robot show page.

Add an event listener to the "Delete" button such that when clicked, it sends a `DELETE` request to the proper API endpoint. When the client receives a return response from the API, it should redirect the user to the robots index page.
