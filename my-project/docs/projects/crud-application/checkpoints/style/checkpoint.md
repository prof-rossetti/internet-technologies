# CRUD Application Checkpoint II: Style

Use a front-end development framework to establish the preliminary structure and style for your CRUD Application.

## Objectives

  1. Practice using a front-end web development framework.
  * Practice responsive web site design.
  * Practice HTML and CSS.
  * Use version control to revert to previous repository versions.

## Prerequisites

  1. [CRUD Application Checkpoint I: Structure](/projects/crud-application/checkpoints/structure/checkpoint.md)
  1. [Personal Website Checkpoint II: Style](/projects/personal-website/checkpoints/style/checkpoint.md)

## Accompanying Materials

  + [Project Repository](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/crud-app-beginnings/)
  + [Commit History](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/crud-app-beginnings/commits/master)
  + [Live Demo](https://prof-rossetti.github.io/crud-app-beginnings/robots/)
  + [Screencast of Development Process](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwjSYkiszsC1Hm7ucmZE7deuQZWZpcxvD)

## Instructions

Create from scratch a web site that mimics the structure and style of https://react-robots.herokuapp.com/. Don't worry about that application's interactive functionality.

### Replay

For a truly immersive experience, step through each of the commits to review the source code and preview the results in a browser.

#### Setup

First clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to it.

```` sh
git clone git@github.com:prof-rossetti/crud-app-beginnings.git
cd crud-app-beginnings/
````

In a new terminal window or tab, start a local web server:

```` sh
# Mac Terminal:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

# Windows Command Prompt:
python â€“m http.server 8888
````

Visit the site at http://localhost:8888/robots/.

#### Step-by-step

Start your step-by-step review by reverting to the first commit.

```` sh
git checkout 0676136 # both the long version of the commit's identifier (e.g. 067613652e924e984561c0b07ffb98bb7ac26c7c) and the short version (e.g. 0676136) can be used to reference the first commit. Reference the commit list and show pages on GitHub, or your local `git log` results to find the commit identifiers.
````

Don't worry if you see a warning about being on a 'detached HEAD' state.

Refresh the browser to see what the site looked like back at that version. Study the source code at that version by viewing the files in your text editor.

Repeat this process for each commit until you reach the last one.

When you are finished, revert back to the most recent version (i.e. that of the current "master" branch) and your repository will no longer be in a 'detached HEAD' state:

```` sh
git checkout master
````

Congratulations, you are starting to utilize the full power of version control!
