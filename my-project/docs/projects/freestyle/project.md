# Group "Freestyle" Project

In groups of two to four, students will propose, plan and implement their own custom web-based business technology products of interest.

## Objectives

  1. Engage in a deliberate lifecycle of software planning, design, and implementation.
  2. Produce a web-based technology product for business purposes.
  3. Leverage technology as an outlet for creativity.
  4. Have fun!

## Requirements

Students have a large degree of flexibility in choosing what kind of product to deliver, however it should meet at least the following criteria:

  1. Serves some practical business purpose, and
  2. Either:
     + A) Leverages Internet technologies introduced in this course (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript), or
     + B) Leverages data shared programmatically over the Internet (for example from a third-party API or website)

Acceptable products include, but are not limited to:

  + Website (beginner)
  + Web Application (intermediate)
  + API Client that gets its data by issuing HTTP requests to a third-party API (intermediate)
  + Web Scraper that gets its data by issuing HTTP requests to a third-party website (intermediate)
  + Mobile Application (advanced, choose at your own risk!)

## Instructions and Deliverables

### Group Selection

Optionally confer with some of your colleagues about forming a team. Each student should fill out this [Group Selection Form](https://forms.gle/qeiqW1o6XQgYjEyk9) by the designated due date. The form asks whether you already have a group you'd like to work with, or whether you'd like the professor to match you with a group. Even if you have a pre-selected team, all team members should fill out the form separately. The form also asks you to share any preliminary project ideas you may have.

### Planning and Design Document

After your group compositions are approved or assigned by the professor, gather with your teammates to ideate a potential web-based product that can serve one or more practical business purposes. This can be a website or web application, or it can be a program that makes use of data from another third-party website or API. If you get stuck, think of an Internet-based platform or service that you use (e.g. Twitter), and see if that service provides an API, and then think of interesting ways to use the provided data.

Create a planning document in PDF format which details the business objective(s) of your product. There are no hard requirements in terms of the document's length font size, or line spacing, however reasonable length including embedded images could be around seven pages. See the sub-sections below for additional prompts about what kind of content to include in this document.

By the designated due date, upload your Planning and Design Document [to Canvas](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/104329/assignments/374352) (one per group).

#### Problem Statement / User Needs

What problem does your product solve? Or what opportunity does it address? For example, does it save someone time? Or does it enable someone to perform certain tasks they wouldn't otherwise be able to perform?

The planning document should describe who your users are, how they'll use the product, and why. Who will your product help, and how? Convey the user needs in terms of "[who] needs [what] so they can [why]".

#### Proposed Solution / Desired Functionality

What does your product do, and how does it address the stated problem? What is its desired functionality?

#### Information Inputs and Outputs

What information inputs (e.g. API data, user inputs, etc.) does your product need in order to perform its desired functionality?

What information outputs (e.g. compiled reports, data aggregations, notification messages, etc.) will your product need to produce, display, or send in order to perform its desired functionality?

#### Technical Feasibility Analysis

Investigate the degree to which your product is implementable from a technical perspective. What technologies, tools, or services (e.g. third-party APIs) will your proposed product depend on? Have you researched the documentation, tutorials, and examples for those technologies? Have you demonstrated your ability to use them? How's it going? What do you "know you know" vs "know you don't know"? Are there any steps remaining to complete your investigation?

#### System Components and Feature Prioritization

Are you able to break-up your system's components into smaller, more manageable pieces (i.e. "features") such that someone could work on one logically-related feature at a time? Which feature(s) are the most important to implement, and which are the "nice to haves"? Which features will you implement first, and why? As applicable, how do you propose to split up the work between all group members?

#### Product Design

As applicable, design the look and feel of your product by creating drawings or other illustrative representations. You may choose to use pencil and paper, whiteboard, or digital design tools. If your design documents don't start in digital format, take a picture or otherwise scan them into digital format. Then embed them into your Planning and Design Document as applicable.

### Implementation

Once you are satisfied with the planned objectives of the product and its ability to meet those objectives as designed, begin developing your product.

If you're developing a website or web application, you may use a front-end web development framework
 like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download-cdn)
 to reduce development efforts and conform to familiar web standards. Regardless of what kind of product you're making, you may also leverage any starter code provided by the professor as the basis of your own product, as long as you provide proper attribution. If you're not sure where to start, feel free to ask the professor for support, including for some example code to help you get started!

Continue developing your product until you are satisfied with its ability to meet its stated objectives. If the stated objectives are large in scope, it's OK to implement a small sub-component of the overall functionality.

If your project is a website or web app, it should ideally be hosted and available for public consumption over the Internet. Websites should be hosted via GitHub Pages, while web applications should be hosted on a Heroku server. If you need help deploying an application to Heroku, ask the professor for support.

Your final project code should reside in a repository on GitHub. By the designated due date, submit the [Project Submission Form](https://forms.gle/pKhPM3N2zqMUisga9) (one per group) and specify the URL of your project repository.

### Presentation

During the designated class period, deliver a seven minute presentation to describe your product and demonstrate its implementation. The implementation need not be entirely complete by this time, but ideally you'll have at least some functionality to show.

Before you deliver your presentation, upload your presentation document in PDF format [to Canvas](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/104329/assignments/385044) (one per group).

### Peer Review

Attend class on the designated presentation day, and fill out a Peer Review Form to evaluate each other group presentation.

## Evaluation

The **Group Selection** and **Peer Review** forms will be evaluated on the basis of whether or not they have been submitted on-time.

The **Planning and Design Document** will be evaluated on the basis of its ability to address the prompt, as represented by the following rubric:

Category | Weight
--- | ---
Problem Statement / User Needs | 20%
Info Inputs and Outputs | 20%
Proposed Solution / Desired Functionality | 20%
Proposed Design | 20%
Thoroughness and clarity of analysis | 20%

The **Presentation** will be evaluated on the basis of content and delivery. Strive to deliver presentations with clarity and confidence. Impressive and memorable demonstrations are a great way to earn top grades. NOTE: Peer evaluations will be factored into the final presentation grade.

The **Implementation** will be evaluated on its ability to function as desired, as represented by the following rubric:

Category | Requirement | Weight
--- | --- | ---
Satisfies Proposed Objectives | Addresses a business problem discussed in the accompanying planning document, in a manner generally consistent with the plan discussed in that document | 20%
Technology Requirements | Uses web-based technologies, issues HTTP requests, or otherwise leverages the Internet | 20%
Uniqueness and Individuality | Exhibits creativity, and a unique set of functionality | 20%
User Experience | Provides a simple, pleasant, and intuitive experience for the user, with clear usage instructions, free of idiosyncrasies or errors | 20%
Dev Process and Documentation | Submitted via GitHub repository which includes a README file with installation and usage instructions (e.g. commands for how to view the website or run the program) | 20%
