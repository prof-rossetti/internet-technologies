## REST API Checkpoint III: Serving Dynamic Responses to GET Requests

Connect the web server to the database, and serve dynamic responses at all of the application's GET request endpoints.

## Objectives

  + Gain exposure to making database calls from within the context of an Express application, and passing database data to the application's views.
  + Practice using an Express web application to handle processing of GET requests.

## Prerequisites

  + [REST API Checkpoint II: Seeding the Database](/projects/rest-api/checkpoints/database-seeding/checkpoint.md)
  + "Verify" your Heroku account by adding credit card information at https://heroku.com/verify. Don't worry, you shouldn't be charged for the resource usage levels recommended by this guide.

## Development Environment Instructions

These instructions describe the process of configuring the development web server to connect to, and query the development database.

### Connect to the Development Database

To configure the web server to start a database connection on start-up, add the following code near the top of the "app.js" file, above the lines where you are requiring your routers:

```` js
// ...
var db = require("./db") // this line is new
var index = require('./routes/index'); // this was here before
var robotsApi = require('./routes/api/robots'); // this was here before
// ...
````

### Query the Development Database

Edit the "routes/api/robots.js" file to resemble the following:

```` js
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
var Robot = require("../../models/robot");

/* List Robots (GET) */

router.get('/api/robots', function(req, res, next) {
  Robot.find( function (err, robots) {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err)
      res.send("OOPS. SERVER ERROR.");
    } else {
      console.log("LIST", robots.length, "ROBOTS:", robots);
      res.send(robots.reverse());
    }
  });
});

/* Show Robot (GET) */

router.get('/api/robots/:id', function(req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.params)
  const robotId = req.params.id;

  Robot.findById(robotId, function(err, robot) {
    if (err){
      errorMessage = `OOPS. SERVER ERROR. Couldn't Show robot ${robotId}. ${err} Please double-check you are requesting a robot with a valid identifier. Try listing all robots to see some examples.`
      console.log(errorMessage)
      res.send(errorMessage);
    } else {
      console.log("SHOW ROBOT", robot);
      res.send(robot);
    };
  });
});

module.exports = router;
````

Note the routers are querying the database and passing the results back via response. Also there's some error-handing, but nothing to crazy. The trick here is reading the mongoose documentation for the `find()` and `findById()` methods.

Visit the endpoints again in your browser to verify the database data is getting passed through in the response.

## Production Environment Instructions

### Configure Production Database

You've configured your development application to connect to a development database on your local machine, but when you push your application to Heroku, you'll notice you also need to configure a production database. Fortunately, Heroku makes it easy to create a MongoDB "addon".

```` sh
heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox
````

> If you get an error complaining about verifying your account, you need to enter your credit card with your Heroku account. Don't worry, the `mongolab:sandbox` addon is free. Sorry you have to enter your credit card info. But again, you shouldn't be charged at this low level of resource usage.

When you create the `mongolab:sandbox` addon, it creates a remote production database server and associates its address with an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI` on the application server.

This will work for us because we have already configured the MongoDB connection string in our "db.js" file to search for an environment variable on the server called `MONGODB_URI`.

### Deploy to Production

Commit your changes to version control if you have not yet done so, then push them to the remote repository, then to the Heroku production application server:

```` sh
git push heroku master
heroku open
````

Test out your GET request endpoints in production. The API is serving appropriate responses for all GET request endpoints! Be proud because this is a major accomplishment.
