# Google Cloud Firestore Database

Let's setup our own database and fetch data from there. We'll use a NoSQL key-value storage option called Firestore from Google. Firestore is available via the Firebase suite of products.

## Database Setup

### Google Cloud Project

Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com). Create a new project, and name it. After it is created, select it from the project selection dropdown menu.

### Firebase Project

Visit the [Google Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) to create a new Firebase project. When you create the project:

  1. Select the Google Cloud project you just created from the dropdown.
  2. Enable Google Analytics.
  3. Configure Google Analytics:
     1. Choose an existing Google Analytics account or create a new one.
     2. Automatically create a new property in this account.


### Firestore Database Setup

Follow [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) (just the "Create a Cloud Firestore database" section), to create a Firestore database for the Firebase project you just created. When you create the database, "start in test mode".

#### Products Collection

After the database has been created, create a new collection called "products" with a number of documents inside. Create each document using an auto-generated `id` attribute, as well as the attributes `name` (string), `description` (string), `price` (number) and `url` (string). Populate the documents based on the following examples:

name | description | price | url
--- | --- | --- | ---
Strawberries | Juicy organic strawberries. | 4.99 | https://picsum.photos/id/1080/360/200
Cup of Tea | An individually-prepared tea or coffee of choice. | 3.49 | https://picsum.photos/id/225/360/200
Textbook | It has all the answers. | 129.99 | https://picsum.photos/id/24/360/200






### Google Cloud Service Account Credentials

To fetch data from the Firestore database (and use other Google APIs), the app will need access to a local "service account" credentials file.

From the [Google API Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page, find the service account created during the Firebase project setup process (it should be called something like "firebase-adminsdk"), or feel free to create a new service account.

For the chosen service account, create new JSON credentials file as necessary from the "Keys" menu, then download the resulting JSON file. You'll need to move a copy of this file into the root directory of your project repository, by convention naming it "google-credentials.json" (see project-specific README files and guidance).
