# React.js Framework Overview

## React Resources

Here is a [Getting Started Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), and a perhaps more helpful guide about [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html). It is important to read about [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html), how [State](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) is managed, and about the [Component Event Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).

There are lots of great Youtube Videos about React by "WebDevSimplified", including [Learn React in 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY).

## Creating React Apps

### From Scratch

If you want to generate a new React app from scratch, the [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) tool is a great choice.

## From a Template

You can also feel free to leverage the professor's [React Starter App with Firebase Auth](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/react-firebase-auth-template-2021) as a template, and extend from there.
