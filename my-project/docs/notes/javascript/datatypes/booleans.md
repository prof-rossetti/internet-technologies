# Booleans

Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean.

In JavaScript, like other languages, `true` and `false` are reserved words which indicate boolean values.

```` js
true
false
````

The most relevant boolean operator is the equality operator:

```` js
true == true //=> true
true == false //=> true
false == false //=> false
````

> "Is this equal to that?"

Also relevant is the inequality operator:

```` js
true != true //=> false
true != false //=> true
false != false //=> false
````

> "Is this not equal to that?"

Reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Comparison_operators for more information about comparison operators.

In JavaScript, there are also "strict" versions of these operators (`===` and `!==`) that also take datatypes into consideration:

```js
5 == "5" //> true
5 === "5" //> false
```
