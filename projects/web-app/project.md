# Web Application Group Project

## Objectives

  1. Create a dynamic and interactive web-based application for business purposes.
  2. Leverage third-party Node.js packages to aid development and enhance application capabilities.
  3. Leverage technology as an outlet for creativity.
  4. Have fun!

## Requirements

Create an interactive website or web application for some practical business purpose. The web app's content can be real or fictitious.

The application should feature at least three pages with consistent style and navigation.

The application should feature some set of interactive functionality, whether it be responding to button click events, submitting web forms, producing interactive data visualizations, etc.

The application logic should be written in JavaScript, either on the client-side and/or the server-side.

The application should fetch data from a back-end database or API, and may ideally also send data to a back-end database or API.

## Groups

Students have the option of working in groups of up to four total members.

To fairly evaluate groups of different sizes, projects may be ranked against others of the same group size.

To incentivize individual effort within groups, each group member may be asked to submit a form describing and rating the roles and relative contributions of all other group members.
