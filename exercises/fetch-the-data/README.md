## Prerequisites

  + ["Crunch the Data" Exercise](/exercises/crunch-the-data/README.md)

  + Write JavaScript code to fetch data over the Internet.
  + Gain familiarity with the JSON data format.

  + [Arrow Functions](/notes/javascript/functions#arrow-functions)

## Instructions

For each of the challenges in the original "Crunch the Data" Exercise, you were provided the data in a given hard-coded variable. But client-side applications will more likely be fetching their data from an API server or external file. So let's practice our ability to fetch data from some JSON files hosted on the web. This should help us prepare to request data from APIs in the future.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Gradebook

Instead of using the hard-coded `gradebook` variable, fetch the data from this ["gradebook.json"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof-rossetti/internet-technologies/9481f9bc2ab69741ff0f66617fbf2f6c2139b56e/exercises/fetch-the-data/gradebook.json) file instead.

### Challenge 2: Rideshare

Instead of using the hard-coded `trip` variable, fetch the data from this ["trip.json" file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof-rossetti/internet-technologies/9481f9bc2ab69741ff0f66617fbf2f6c2139b56e/exercises/fetch-the-data/trip.json) instead.

### Challenge 3: Social Media

Instead of using the hard-coded `tweets` variable, fetch the data from this ["tweets.json" file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof-rossetti/internet-technologies/9481f9bc2ab69741ff0f66617fbf2f6c2139b56e/exercises/fetch-the-data/tweets.json) instead.
